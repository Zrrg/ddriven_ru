Byakuren: Examine WALL SCROLL.
Byakuren: 
0000019:
You're particularly proud of this scroll which is why you've 
left it hanging up here right above your bed. It used to be 
your brother's, back when he was still around. 
Событие №:3
0000020:
Вот юная леди в своей комнате. Так уж вышло, что сегодня,
в 13 день Шивасу, у неё День рождения. И хоть прошло
уже несколько лет с того момента, как ей подарили жизнь,
имя она получит лишь сейчас!
0000021:
What will the name of this young lady be?
0000022:
Oh, wait, just like everyone else, she came with a 
DESIGNATED NAMETAG  shortly after her birth. 
What does that NAMETAG say on it?
0000023:
\c[30]\.\.\.\>                                               \<BYAKUREN HIJIRI\.\c[0]
0000024:

0000025:Варианты выбора:
Be Byakuren.
0000026:
Your name is BYAKUREN. As was previously mentioned, 
and is as written in thousands of other adventures like this, 
it is your BIRTHDAY. Or at least, what you assume it to be. 
0000027:
Your INTERESTS don't include much, really, as having INTERESTS 
leads to one being too materialistic, which you perceive as an 
incredibly BAD THING. Your room is almost empty save for hints 
of your LOVE FOR SCRIBING and studying PSYCHURGY.
0000028:
Just like your late BROTHER, you are an aspiring MAGICIAN. 
From time to time, you also like to partake in COMPETITIVE 
ACTIVITIES against people. Additionally, as a health nut, 
you're actually incredibly fit and STRONG for your age. 
0000029:
You go by the preachhandle: \c[5]virtuousBlossom\c[0].

This is the name you use when talking to people online.
0000030:
You \c[5]converse in a way that's coated with subtle vilification.\c[0]
0000031:
It just so happens that today was also the day that you
and a few friends decided to initiate in a friendly 
competition via playing a game another friend had just
recently coded for the occasion. Competition is fun.
0000032:
However, there's no need to rush. You are free to
explore around your house before getting down into
business.\. Right now, you're just waiting for the mail
to arrive.
0000033:
Speak of the devil, looks like someone's at the door.  That
should probably be the aforementioned package.
0000034:

0000035:Варианты выбора:
Byakuren: Retrieve package.
0000036:Варианты выбора:
Byakuren: Open package.
0000037:
Oh, it's the OTHER PACKAGE. This one is from your
DRUNKARD OF A FRIEND. 

There's a little note attached to it.
0000038:

0000039:Варианты выбора:
Byakuren: Read note.
0000040:
\c[4]hey hijiri happy birthday!! don't forget to take the tiger
back to mike tyson's house without dying!!!  
0000041:
\c[4]you're a cool friend so i thought you'd want this thing… 
i've had it since i was little and its kinda important to me and
you're a cool friend like i said so i'm giving it to you so 
take care of it ok –from DB\c[0]
0000042:
Well, that was nice of them. You're surprised they actually 
remembered your birthday, though. It seems like they're the 
only one who sent you anything resembling a present. You're 
not into material things, but it's a bit heartwarming.
0000043:
You've never seen a real live tiger before in your life.
They've probably died off due to human cruelty or just 
overhunting in general. That's a shame, really. 
0000044:
Or… perhaps, they just never existed in the first place and 
are just a myth. A made-up creature for bedtime stories.

Who knows? 
0000045:

0000046:Варианты выбора:
Byakuren: Captchalogue tiger doll.
0000047:

0000048:Варианты выбора:
Byakuren: Consider a complaint.
0000049:
This wasn't the right package. You should go confront the
expected sender about the whereabouts of the package you've
been waiting for.

Byakuren: Exposit on whatever that was all about.
0000134:
Oh, that's right. You had recently switched out your
fetch modus for INVENTORRENT like everyone else
when you all decided to play this game. It's what you
use as sort of like an inventory. Like in the video games.
0000135:
Everything you captchalogue can be seeded and leeched 
by everyone you have in your file sharing group to
erase the hassles of captcha codes in order to ensure 
a successful group effort.
0000136:
This is also to make sure that nobody captchalogues
anything harmful while working with others as all items
are visible to everyone in the group.
0000137:
Thankfully, it has a system that allows you to either set
captchalogued items to public or private. Yours has been 
set to public by default as you totally have nothing to hide. 
0000138:
However, the file sharing was rigged to not activate until both 
team leaders approve. You and this other person have agreed 
not to activate it until everyone is playing the game. For now, it 
works like a regular fetch modus. It's a pretty handy fetch modus.

0000212:
A primordial note is produced.
0000213:


It's the one Hesitancy plays to keep its followers at bay. 
0000214:


It is your sixteenth birthday, and as with all fifteen preceding it, 
something feels missing from your life.
0000215:
The game presently eluding you is only the latest test of faith 
in the tomes of an unseen anchorite, one to engender a sense 
not of fidelity, but of skepticism. Her stark chants are those 
less of a priest than a common tramp.
0000216:
Her gospel is Validation itself. It is a mystery dispersing 
altogether, like the moon's feigned facade, with even one 
stone of absolution cast into its oceans. It is the most 
profane gospel of all.
0000217:
"It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. 
This is how the whole scheme of things works."

0000228:
Your name is NUE. You are currently in the middle of a 
SHITTY TEMPLE due to PEER PRESSURE.  You have a 
variety of strange INTERESTS. You love dabbling in 
CRYPTID LORE and exploring GENETIC MUTATIONS.
0000229:
You also enjoy ROLEPLAYING with your friend but you try to 
play it off as BEING IRONIC due to your LOW SELF-ESTEEM.
You are not too fond of SOCIAL NORMS and RULES. That
stuff just isn't your style.
0000230:
This is is why you've chosen to live in a very OBSCURE 
LOCATION. You have a penchant for PRANKS though it's 
rather hard to prank anyone when you live so far
away from CIVILIZATION. 
0000231:

Well, at least you got your CD back. It looks a little scratched

are they giving you trouble or anythin like that?
0000548:talk_nue6

kinda ego-trips whenever she opens her mouth.
and she gets mad easily too... so it's kinda hard
talking to her sometimes.

as she had been fretting over the game for the past few weeks.

HUNGER for LITERATURE. You love nothing more than 
GETTING DOWN AND DIRTY with CREATIVE WRITING, 
specifically of the POETRY category. 
0000581:
Your topics often involve DYSOTOPIAS and other rather 
DARK, DEPRESSING TOPICS. You often base your writing 
on the many DISTRESSING VISIONS you witness in 
your wake.

Other times, you write FOOD REVIEWS. When you're not 
writing, you're obviously EATING as if it were your LAST MEAL. 
You are quite COENACULOUS.

\c[8]DV: Good morrow, Prince, I’m aware it’s 
rather late but I have to tell you of this as it’s 
rather urgent.
0000590:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: at ease, Miyako. you can tell me.

what is it?
0000591:talk_yoshika4
\c[8]DV: Well, it appears, I had a slight 
miscalculation… about our fate with this game?
0000592:talk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]VV: oh, how so? either way, I’m sure 
we’ll do just fine no matter what it is! we’re 
destined to beat Hijiri.
0000593:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: No, it’s not that, it’s more that there will 
be thirteen players rather than twelve as I’d 
previously stated. 
0000594:talk_miko6
!pep!\c[12]VV: huh, 13? are you sure about that?
I honestly thought that the game only allowed
even numbers of players.
0000595:talk_yoshika6
\c[8]DV: Something just so unexpected as if
one were venturing across the span of an
entire highway only to realize you've been
following the wrong road signs, understand?
0000596:talk_miko4
!pep!\c[12]VV: yes, I think so. though, i have
to say, this is a rather confusing ordeal.
0000597:talk_yoshika6
\c[8]DV: Yes, it's true that it's quite the predicament, 
as it’s not an even number, but either way, we’ll be 
greatly imbalanced if we continue on with teams.
0000598:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: Perhaps there could be a reason as
to us being uneven, as it would be unfair to rule
out a player, especially if somehow, they got
their copy to work, right? 
0000599:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: yeah, i see truth in that. we don’t 
have to do teams then. i’m fine with daisy chaining 
with those guys.
0000600:talk_miko6
!pep!\c[12]VV: I honestly just hope Hijiri will be 
okay with that too. she's kind of uptight and all.
0000601:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: I already told the hermit about it, in fact, 
I have a feeling that she will be pestering me about 
it right now, so I will have to ask for you to excuse 
me, if that's alright.
0000602:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: it's fine.
0000603:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: but, before I let you go, do tell
me this: does your modified copy work? I mean,
we're using your old one as a base, and I'd like
to know if it's functional.
0000604:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: \.\.\.Yes,\. it works. I just had to have
HH change a few things, but they got the job 
done quite well.
0000605:talk_miko3
!pep!\c[12]VV: that's good. looks like we're all
well-prepared and ready to go.

\c[8]DV: Hello.
0000613:talk_seiga1
!pep!\c[9]VH: Did you tell the prince about it? 
Your vision, I mean. Or dreams, whatever you
want to call them.
0000614:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: Yes, I have informed her of the situation,
and she took it quite well.
0000615:talk_seiga3
!pep!\c[9]VH: That’s wonderful~ 
But, it’s truly a bother, is it not? Knowing that
this new addition is not on our side? 
0000616:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]VH: If they were, I would've heard
wind of them.
0000617:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: I agree, it’s a little concerning.
0000618:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]VH: Yes, I knew you’d say something
like that! That’s why I prepared something 
beforehand. Just for you, Yoshika. I'm sure
you'll like it.
0000619:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: Oh, you knew about the 13th player?
0000620:talk_seiga3
!pep!\c[9]VH: Well, no, I'm referring to something else.
I've been meaning to even out the playing field.

If you get what I mean.
0000621:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: Are you referring to people on Hijiri's 
side, despite my constant reminders of how you
shouldn't meddle with them?
0000622:talk_seiga1
!pep!\c[9]VH: Yes. Two of them.
0000623:talk_yoshika5
\c[8]DV: I’ve warned you before not to start 
quarrels with them, for our sakes too... Think, 
what if they end up turning hostile on us? 
That's something I'd want us to avoid...
0000624:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]VH: If there's less of them, then we'll
eventually gain the upper hand. Especially 
towards the end, don't you think so? Like hell
I'll share a prize with Hijiri and her cohorts.
0000625:talk_yoshika6
\c[8]DV: You are aware that the reason we 
require their assistance is to make our entry 
easier, as well as their grounded combat
experience... we really need their trust.
0000626:talk_yoshika5
\c[8]DV: Most of them are going to make the 
game a cakewalk for all of us, or perhaps you're
doing this as some sort of conquest for revenge?
Revenge only begets more revenge!
0000627:talk_seiga4
!pep!\c[9]VH: Fine, I won’t do anything weird.
I was just kidding anyway. Geez, Yoshika, you’re
such a buzz-kill, you know that? 
0000628:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]VH: But, that’s okay, I guesssss~
I mean, you shouldn't be scolding me when
you're also a pretty good liar.
0000629:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: ...\.\.\.Well.
0000630:talk_yoshika4
\c[8]DV: I'd love to keep chatting with you
but I have to go, something came up.
0000631:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]VH: You're so full of shit sometimes. But, 
that's to be expected since we were all born and 
raised by hypocrites. We'll be like this from the 
cradle to the grave. 
0000632:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]VH: Spawns of war and peace, like a confused 
rap-country mashup. We're just stories and 
disciples in the end. Like history, which is what
we will be if we don't get rid of them.
0000633:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: That was the most strangely poetic, 
albeit rather cryptic, message I've ever 
gotten from you.
0000634:talk_seiga3
!pep!\c[9]VH: I think it's adorable that you're 
trying to dodge the point here~
0000635:talk_yoshika6
\c[8]DV: You genuinely perceive me to be a liar?
0000636:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]VH: You know your way around wordplay, 
so of course I do. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, 
since it's a useful skill. It certainly worked for you. 
0000637:talk_seiga3
!pep!\c[9]VH: We all have a place to go when we die, 
but you seemed to have avoided it. 
Aren't you quite the bastard~
0000638:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]VH: You should teach me.
0000639:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: That's rather ironic.
0000640:talk_seiga1
!pep!\c[9]VH: What was that?
0000641:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: It's nothing, it's unimportant.
0000642:talk_yoshika3
\c[8]DV: You are just overthinking things.
0000643:talk_seiga4
!pep!\c[9]VH: I know you’re just saying that 
because you hate talking to me, don’t you? 
Is it because I called you a liar? 
:(
0000644:talk_seiga4
!pep!\c[9]VH: See? That’s a sad face!
0000645:talk_seiga6
!pep!\c[9]VH: Ugh, fine!

I guess it’d be nice if we had an easy start,
I suppose. 
0000646:talk_seiga4
!pep!\c[9]VH: You always mention that you were going 
to die later, though, I highly doubt it considering 
that you saw a "vision" about it, so you should 
know how to avoid it, no? 
0000647:talk_seiga5
!pep!\c[9]VH: Come on, Yoshika, you’re smart.
And quit avoiding me so much! 
0000648:talk_yoshika1
\c[8]DV: I am aware but visions always go as 
predicted, I cannot stop them. That's out of 
my control.
0000649:talk_yoshika6
\c[8]DV: One of the reasons I want to play this
game is to be rid of this... hindrance... once
and for all, as being an exempt the last time is 
perhaps the reason I am here now.\.
0000650:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]VH: Last time? What are you talking
about? When we were dividing into teams or...
does it run deeper than that? I can never really
read you too well, so please enlighten me.
0000651:talk_yoshika4
\c[8]DV: Apologies, I do not have time to
continue responses, so excuse me, I really 
have to retrieve my mail, for I have many 
reasons to believe it could be urgent.
0000652:talk_seiga4
!pep!\c[9]VH: Oh.\. 

Fine.
0000653:talk_seiga4
!pep!\c[9]VH: Yoshika, I'm sorry. Let me make it

A.S.A.P.
0000672:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: yes, I’m aware that this is about 
the extra player. 
0000673:talk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]VV: honestly, I thought my other 
teammate was just numerically-challenged 
when she kept referring to the number of 
players as 13 rather than 12.
0000674:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: So you knew? Or were you the one who 
had coaxed Nue into letting their friend enter in? 
Or were you using her to let someone else get 
on your side for a better chance of winning?
0000675:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: ha, I’m really sorry, Hijiri, I’m 
not that petty of a person. it certainly wasn’t me 
who let them in. I’m not the type to use someone 
for my own gains.
0000676:talk_miko2

0000679:talk_byakuren5
\c[5]VB: Moving on, since you knew about the 
situation, why didn’t you tell me?
0000680:talk_miko6
!pep!\c[12]VV: I just found out. Miyako had told 
me just 5 minutes ago. it seems like there's
another copy that went to someone unlisted.
0000681:talk_byakuren5
\c[5]VB: So, how do you expect for us to remedy 
this situation? It’s extremely unwise to play the 
game with an uneven amount of players. You
should have known that from Miyako as well.
0000682:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: She's the one leading everyone around,
and she just happens to be under your company,
so I have the right to assume that you all should
be quite knowledgeable about these things.
0000683:talk_miko6
!pep!\c[12]VV: Hijiri, please, we can choose to work 
together. I honestly do not mind that so long as 
you don't harm anyone on my team.\.

anything to screw them over, capiche? 
0000689:talk_miko6
!pep!\c[12]VV: because if one person gets the bad 
end of things, it will create a domino effect. we are 
only as strong as our weakest soldier, please, 
remember that, for the sake of everyone else.
0000690:talk_miko1

!pep!\c[12]VV: yes, I’m aware that this is about 
the extra player. 
0000707:talk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]VV: honestly, I thought my other 
teammate was just numerically-challenged 
when she kept referring to the number of 
players as 13 rather than 12.
0000708:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: So you knew? Or were you the one who 
had coaxed Nue into letting their friend enter in? 
Or were you using her to let someone else get 
on your side for a better chance of winning?
0000709:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: ha, I’m really sorry, Hijiri, I’m 
not that petty of a person. it certainly wasn’t me 
who let them in. I’m not the type to use someone 
for my own gains.
0000710:talk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]VV: I would be winking as hard as I
can right now but you'd see that and you'd 
probably get all hostile and suspicious. 
0000711:talk_byakuren1
\c[5]VB: …Apologies but was that directed 
at me?
0000712:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: Nevermind, that's not important.\.
0000713:talk_byakuren5
\c[5]VB: Moving on, since you knew about the 
situation, why didn’t you tell me?
0000714:talk_miko6
!pep!\c[12]VV: I just found out. Miyako had told 
me just 5 minutes ago. it seems like there's
another copy that went to someone unlisted.
0000715:talk_byakuren5
\c[5]VB: So, how do you expect for us to remedy 
this situation? It’s extremely unwise to play the 
game with an uneven amount of players. You
should have known that from Miyako as well.
0000716:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: She's the one leading everyone around,
and she just happens to be under your company,
so I have the right to assume that you all should
be quite knowledgeable about these things.
0000717:talk_miko6
!pep!\c[12]VV: Hijiri, please, we can choose to work 
together. I honestly do not mind that so long as 
you don't harm anyone on my team.\.
0000718:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: I figured. I volunteer the newest 
addition to serve first.
0000719:talk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]VV: whoa there, soldier, since when did you 
speak for the entire group?
0000720:talk_byakuren5
\c[5]VB: When we were appointing leaders 
(i.e. you and I).
0000721:talk_miko4
!pep!\c[12]VV: oh right, good point.
0000722:talk_miko6
!pep!\c[12]VV: I’m just going to guess that you 
already asked them, I trust that you don’t do 
anything to screw them over, capiche? 
0000723:talk_miko6
!pep!\c[12]VV: because if one person gets the bad 
end of things, it will create a domino effect. we are 
only as strong as our weakest soldier, please, 
remember that, for the sake of everyone else.
0000724:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: anyway, I’m going to try and set up a small 
graph to clear things up and while I’m at this, it 
would be great if you set up a memo for everyone. 
I hope I'm not being too demanding here.
0000725:talk_byakuren1
\c[5]VB: Understood.
0000726:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: we can tell them about the 
situation there. let’s keep it organized if we 
want to do this in the most efficient way 
possible!
0000727:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: Okay, General. I got you the first time.
0000728:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: I'm sure it won't be that bad.
0000729:talk_byakuren1
\c[5]VB: Whatever you say.

Some sort of food fanatics board.
0000763:talk_futo1
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Pray tell, why invite me here, 
bro? Are you in the mood to discuss breakfast
with the enemy?
0000764:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]CVV: this is the memo Hijiri made. 
we’re teaming up with them now since we have 
13 people.
0000765:talk_futo2
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Oh, I am aware! I always found it strange 
that you all referred to it as 12 but I knew it was 
13. Furthermore, I would like to mention that 
teaming up is quite odd to agree on at this point.
0000766:talk_futo3
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Though, it is more than terrific that 
you all have come to your senses and finally 
listened to the Taomeister.

0000769:talk_futo6

not too well-versed on modern coding language. 
I cannot make sense of that list bit there.
0000770:talk_futo3
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Although, I will definitely greet you 
with a good tut-tut HELLO! Such as that, as you
see right there.

0000773:talk_futo2

make sure the golem I am building for HV 
does not have some kind of self-destruction 
bug in the works.
0000774:talk_futo3
!pep!\c[11]?VD: But I shall definitely keep this 
board saved for future reference! Just another
addition to the many I am in with others.
0000775:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]CVV: hey, the bot’ll look really great 
when it’s done, by the way. you're really
getting much better at it, you know?
0000776:talk_futo1
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Ahh, then I am excited to get 
it finished! Thank you. 
0000777:talk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]CVV: nice. I’m still making the chart, 
so invite more people, if you will, Hijiri. thank you.
0000778:talk_miko4
!pep!\c[12]CVV: speaking of which, I’m not sure 
what’s taking VH and DV so long.
0000779:talk_futo2
!pep!\c[11]?VD: The latter is being scrote-gripped 
by the former, as usual. They shall come around, 
don’t worry. 
0000780:talk_futo2
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Maybe they're playing go together? 
VH is quite excellent at the game, and I oft find
myself wasting hours playing with her. Perhaps the
same is happening to DV?\.\. 'Til then, I bid thee adieu.

idk why tho. maybe they wanted to 
talk to that VD person?? ??

installation and such. I've already got her
things nice and ready.
0000862:talk_seiga1
!pep!\c[9]CVH: That aside, it’s not good to clutter 
up the board with strange messages, especially 
ones that sound as profane as HV's, all the time. 
Don’t mind her.

0000868:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]CVH: True, we don’t have to talk much 
when you’re serving for me anyway, which 
will be a good thing, for both of us, I take it.
0000869:talk_seiga6
!pep!\c[9]CVH: Honestly, they should have
assigned someone better. I can't believe
you're the reason this memo was even
created for.
0000870:talk_mamizou6
\c[13]CBH: whoa turn down the rude

no need to be so agonistic
0000871:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]CVH: Maybe you should shape up first.
My problem is that you might not have the
proper reading comprehension skills necessary
to even read the guide for this game.
0000872:talk_seiga6
!pep!\c[9]CVH: And, in turn, you would probably
end up ruining my chances with this game.
0000873:talk_mamizou3
\c[8]CBH: "No, I understand completely, you wish
for me to talk like this, in a super pretentious
and psuedo-dignified manner, so we may 
exchange boring retorts at one another!"
0000874:talk_mamizou2
\c[11]CBH: "Or perchance even in a tone such
as this, broham. I can talk like a total dweebmaster
for you, if that is what you consider to be 
fulfilling for an anchorite such as yourself!"
0000875:talk_mamizou5
\c[3]CBH: "Wha' about this? Ain't this appealin'? 
I've got me wee accent goin' on t' pair up wito me 
super lame chivalrous douche bag natter. 
Yeah, ye'd love this every message."

but i dont think you guys should  be fighting 
here in the memo
0000878:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]CVH: I just don't like dealing with
low-lives. It's not a very good image to put
yourself up to. I'm still wondering whether or
not they can even read.
0000879:talk_seiga3
!pep!\c[9]CVH: Oh yeah, pink text is atrocious, 
by the way.

that is to be my server player, I’m going to take 
my leave so I can do a few things.
0000884:talk_seiga2
!pep!\c[9]CVH: You're free to just talk as yourself.
I'd rather have a calm hick serve me rather
than an crazy, sarcastic one.

0000891:talk_nue6
\c[6]CHB: i guess you should just bite the bullet
for now. it's temporary anyway!
0000892:talk_nazrin1
\c[1]CHH: Actually, she'll be sticking around nearby
for as long as we play this game.
0000893:talk_nazrin2

0000894:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]CVB: Nazrin, can I ask you not to say such
things, please?
0000895:talk_mamizou2
\c[13]CBH: awh man whatever its all just
sass anyway, so its not that big of a problem
0000896:talk_nazrin1
\c[1]CHH: I don't know about that, but you're
free to be optimistic all you want. She's not
my client.
0000897:talk_miko4
!pep!\c[12]CVV: none of you totally listened to 
me when I said not to cross her. you all really 
should learn to listen. we're all human here, right? 
we should know better.
0000898:talk_mamizou5
\c[13]CBH: naw it was just all bark no bite,
i honestly think it aint somethin to be all riled
up over
0000899:talk_kyouko6
\c[7]CBV: you gotta admit she was being snooty. 
she even said she already put down her clients 
stuff before we even got started like... i dunno 
that just seems super shady to me!! !!
0000900:talk_mamizou6
\c[13]CBH: ill just set my thing up for her now 
so she wont be all up yellin in my face later
0000901:talk_miko6

anything stupid like that again, please.
especially not with her.
0000902:talk_mamizou6
\c[13]CBH: to be honest i was kind of hopin to
have made her laugh but i guess that backfired
0000903:talk_ichirin4
\c[2]CBB: Maybe you should apologize to her
later??? i mean maybe thatll ease her up????
0000904:talk_kyouko6

Looks like the memo is dying down a bit. There really is
nothing left for you to do but wait for the rest of the 
server/client list just as some of the others are. 
0000909:
You're trying to make sure that you would be 
somewhere in the middle so you could assist but 
not jump into things as fast and burden your 
server player.
0000910:
Now would be a good time to grab something for your
STRIFE SPECIBUS,  but there's no need to rush.\.

Some sort of food fanatics board.
0000957:talk_futo1
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Pray tell, why invite me here, 
bro? Are you in the mood to discuss breakfast
with the enemy?
0000958:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]CVV: this is the memo Hijiri made. 
we’re teaming up with them now since we have 
13 people.
0000959:talk_futo2
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Oh, I am aware! I always found it strange 
that you all referred to it as 12 but I knew it was 
13. Furthermore, I would like to mention that 
teaming up is quite odd to agree on at this point.
0000960:talk_futo3
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Though, it is more than terrific that 
you all have come to your senses and finally 
listened to the Taomeister.

not too well-versed on modern coding language. 
I cannot make sense of that list bit there.
0000964:talk_futo3

with a good tut-tut HELLO! Such as that, as you
see right there.

make sure the golem I am building for HV 
does not have some kind of self-destruction 
bug in the works.
0000968:talk_futo3
!pep!\c[11]?VD: But I shall definitely keep this 
board saved for future reference! Just another
addition to the many I am in with others.
0000969:talk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]CVV: hey, the bot’ll look really great 
when it’s done, by the way. you're really
getting much better at it, you know?
0000970:talk_futo1

it finished! Thank you. 
0000971:talk_miko2

so invite more people, if you will, Hijiri. thank you.
0000972:talk_miko4
!pep!\c[12]CVV: speaking of which, I’m not sure 
what’s taking VH and DV so long.
0000973:talk_futo2
!pep!\c[11]?VD: The latter is being scrote-gripped 
by the former, as usual. They shall come around, 
don’t worry. 
0000974:talk_futo2
!pep!\c[11]?VD: Maybe they're playing go together? 
VH is quite excellent at the game, and I oft find
myself wasting hours playing with her. Perhaps the
same is happening to DV?\.\. 'Til then, I bid thee adieu.

It's your personal collection of favorite flicks. That's why they
get to be here in your room for easy access. Most of them
follow the same basic structure, just with different-looking
protagonists. Despite that, they all parallel each other.

These are extremely rare models!

You could say this is probably your favorite thing in the room.
It's the only thing that keeps you calm when you get frustrated

Your friend sent these to you, aside from the really useless
skate demos. They're rather old and some of them are
missing frames but you love them, regardless. There's
just something about the grainy visuals that get to you.
0002577:
You keep your tools in here. There are little arrowheads in 
there for safekeeping. Sometimes you make your own 
arrows. That just means that every shot is extremely
valuable. It keeps you from going ham on your bow.

a package just now, as I have?
0002914:talk_tojiko1
\c[10]HV: You got one too?? It just appeared here 
in my room.
0002915:talk_yoshika1
!pep!\c[8]DV: Yes, it’s from Seiga, isn’t it?
0002916:talk_tojiko6
\c[10]HV: I figured, since she’s always fucking 
around with that stupid sendificator of hers.
0002917:talk_yoshika1
!pep!\c[8]DV: She has already set up all my things and is 
doing everything on schedule as I believed she 
would so I highly doubt she was playing the joker’s 
part and sending everyone strange packages.
0002918:talk_tojiko6
\c[10]HV: I guess. She’s really weird, kind of 
like the certain someone I talked to a little
while ago.
0002919:talk_yoshika1
!pep!\c[8]DV: Yes, but the latter is not aware of their 
actions for they are unable to determine whether 
or not, in any circumstances, that they are doing 
it on purpose though, unlike Seiga, definitely.
0002920:talk_yoshika1
!pep!\c[8]DV: Though, in all honesty, I admire your 
quick-to-forgive attitude, but I can tell there is still 
some dwindling grudge in there.
0002921:talk_tojiko1
\c[10]HV: Ah, well\..\..\..
0002922:talk_tojiko6
\c[10]HV: I know it was mean of them to do that, especially 
out of jealousy, like a stupid baby who shits  
their diapers!! But, I know people do stupid things 
when they're trapped in between shitty emotions.
0002923:talk_tojiko4
\c[10]HV: But, it wasn't out of malice, well, initially!! 
I can sort of understand what they were trying 
to get at, but their aim sucks. At least they’re 
apologizing for it.
0002924:talk_yoshika6
!pep!\c[8]DV: Ah, yes, this accursed human 
disease called infatuation.
0002925:talk_tojiko3
\c[10]HV: Do you like anyone, Yoshika??
0002926:talk_tojiko2
\c[10]HV: I mean, now that we're on the subject,
I'm a little curious.
0002927:talk_yoshika6
!pep!\c[8]DV: Nothing further than comraderie, as such 
relations are unimportant and rather poisonous, 
an example is that when things go wrong, the other 
can easily stab you in the back as they lured you in.
0002928:talk_yoshika4

and just like books, be easily torn as they were 
picked up.
0002929:talk_yoshika1

such feelings towards another? If you do, I will 
judge you no wrong, don't worry, my own 
opinions should not affect you.
0002930:talk_tojiko6
\c[10]HV: I guess,\.\. but yeah, you're right, it's not 
important!! It'll probably pass. It's fucking stupid 
and pointless to even think about this stuff!!
0002931:talk_yoshika3
!pep!\c[8]DV: Good girl, we shouldn't stray from the 
original agenda, unlike most, which I don't 
understand why they would make this their main 
focus, blinding them from more important matters.
0002932:talk_tojiko2
\c[10]HV: Yeah, well, anyway, I guess we both 
have packages. That’s what you came to talk 
about, right??
0002933:talk_yoshika1

a stupid fucking competition… it won’t matter 
in the end, huh??
0002938:talk_yoshika6

0002939:talk_tojiko3
\c[10]HV: Aww, cheer up, Yoshika!!

first, just set up all my stuff and I’ll contact you 
again when I’m ready to jump into the fray like

that does not rhyme nor does it make as much

0003007:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: It is very important that you tell 
the prince to serve for you, moreover, you should
burn a copy of your own server CD, as, I assume
it's unused at the moment.
0003008:talk_futo4
\c[11]CVD: The game already recorded IDs 
between both of us. I am not allowed 
to be served by anyone but Tojiko!
0003009:talk_futo6
\c[11]CVD: Even so! The crown prince only has
one server CD and that is reserved for Hijiri! 
Entertaining the idea of it still concludes that 
someone, in the end, will lack a server.
0003010:talk_futo6
\c[11]CVD: Which would most likely be me, as 
Tojiko is absent. Even if I did burn multiple 
copies of my own server CD, there is nobody 
that can overwrite the registration for me.
0003011:talk_futo5
\c[11]CVD: Not even the prince is able to do
such a feat!
0003012:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: Well, yes, the unused copy is not 
for the prince, so don't worry about it, you will 
know in due time who you should give that to.
0003013:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: She needs to obtain Tojiko’s 
pendant, that is all, as with that, she can gain 
Tojiko’s server ‘rights’ and serve for you with 
her own CD whilst serving for Byakuren as well. 
0003014:talk_futo4
\c[11]CVD: How are you even aware of all this 
knowledge? Did you go through the same troubles
as I am having as of current? If so, then why
didn't the prince tell us anything? Or even Tojiko?
0003015:talk_yoshika2_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: It’s been a while, Futo, I just know, 
alright? There's a reason why we set up this
private memo ages ago, as I trust you out of all
of them.
0003016:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: You're the most open to this sort 
of thing, as I am sure the prince would
have declined if I even spoke to her of this.
0003017:talk_futo6
\c[11]CVD: I suppose... I still find it perplexing
to be talking to several Yoshikas. But, such is
life and life is very mysterious.
0003018:talk_yoshika2_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: Just make sure to tell her
to barge into that mausoleum of hers, and how 
you go about telling her is up to you, and do not
forget about burning a server copy.
0003019:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: It's still unused, correct?
0003020:talk_futo6
\c[11]CVD: Yes, but...
0003021:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: It will be important later.
0003022:talk_futo4
\c[11]CVD: And what of the pendant? I just
tell the prince to retrieve it, simple as that?
0003023:talk_yoshika4_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: There is something under the
mausoleum near her home, and I'm aware that 
she's not allowed in there but for the sake of all 
that's been lost, she must try.
0003024:talk_yoshika3_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: It's an extremely dangerous
task but I am sure she will be able to do it,
after all, there is a reason why we chose her
as our leader, aside from the royalty thing.
0003025:talk_futo5
\c[11]CVD: Is Tojiko unable to simply give the
pendant to us herself? Since she cannot give me
the captcha code for it, I shall tell the prince to 
activate everyone's moduses.
0003026:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: Therein lies your problem, currently, 
"Tojiko" herself does not have the pendant, and 
even then, she holds not the ability to even give 
it to anyone at the moment, at least not this early.
0003027:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: The prince has to fetch it, herself,
from another Tojiko, so to speak.
0003028:talk_futo4
\c[11]CVD: Multiple Yoshikas and Tojikos...
0003029:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: You of all people should learn to
understand this phenomenon.
0003030:talk_futo6
\c[11]CVD: So, if the crown prince has the 
pendant, she is allowed to serve for me, 
correct? The pendant alone is able to transfer 
server ID?
0003031:talk_yoshika1_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: Yes, it's actually a glitch, or an
exploit, if you prefer that term, and once she
indulges in said exploit by taking the pendant,
she will gain Tojiko's server 'rights' for you.
0003032:talk_yoshika3_b
!pep!\c[8]?DV: Posthaste, Futo, no dillydallying. 
0003033:talk_futo4

Why would I do such an imbecilic thing?
I do not fancy this "timeline roleplaying" of

\c[27]nn: [ we're both good with reading what lies

The IMPETUOUS MERCENARY has caught hold of you!
0003556:
You cautiously try to give them one of your CHOCOLATE
WAFERS but they only proceed to FLIP THE FUCK OUT
because they are apparently allergic to THAT FLAVOR.
They think insensitive pricks like you deserve JAIL-TIME.
0003557:
You have nothing to bribe the IMPETUOUS MERCENARY with
as you are OUT OF WAFERS! They bark at you once before
hauling your sorry arse off to JAIL.
0003558:
They sniff about the air and notice you are in possession
of some delicious VANILLA WAFERS. You offer to give them
one if, in return, they let you go. They nod excitingly and
proceed to voraciously consume the WAFER.
0003559:
Bred as scouts, their amazing eyesight penetrates past
your pants and they notice your WAFERS. You wince at the
blatant INVASION OF PRIVACY but offer them the WAFER
as a bribe. They scoff a "thank you," and let you go.
0003560:
They hold you up by your legs, shaking you until you drop 
a VANILLA WAFER. They collect the "bribe" quite happily but,  
upon taking your leave, you hear them make a snide 
remark about GOLDEN LOSERS OF THE BATTLEFIELD.
0003561:
They try to nip at your pants pocket before you begrudgingly
give up a VANILLA WAFER. You realize that you're almost
out of them but the guard doesn't seem to care. They grab
the WAFER out of your hand and leave you be... for now.
0003562:
You are out of wafers! You should have been more careful.
At this rate, the look-outs will ACTUALLY do their JOBS and
will most likely haul your princely ass to the slammer if you
get caught one more time. So, don't mess up!

You nod as they explain that they don't want to see you

you are telling them they have no right to life.
0003793:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: The majority of them are sent out

0003795:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: A small amount of CRYPTIDS

the child instead of going by NAMETAG.
0003799:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse

!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: But, if they do die in battle, they
receive the great honour of a burial at sea! This
means their carcasses will be saved the 
embarassment of CRYPTID AUTOPSIES.
0003804:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Due to the need for technical
knowledge of maintaining the warships, most
MARINERS are low-tier HUMANS, falling in the
GAMMA or DELTA categories.
0003805:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Their imminent face-to-face with
their own doom often make would-be MARINERS
rather sociopathic, which is why they are often
left by CARETAKERS at earlier ages than normal.
0003806:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: In other words, they have this knack of 
being known as... socially inept. This seems to 
be normal since it's believed that they are better 
off hating life since they are bred to die.
0003807:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: MARINERS are strange in that 
they are the only humans allowed to be drafted, 
aside from politicians. I should know, I care
for one. They're extremely rude. Avoid them.
0003808:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: The majority of CRYPTIDS are often
sent off to war. They usually have no idea what
they are fighting for but being in GOD's military
is the only way they can move up civilian ranks.
0003809:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: In other words, it's the quickest way
for them to achieve a respectable position in
society. Since they are all bred in the labs,
there aren't really many PUREBED CRYPTIDS.
0003810:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: PUREBREDS seem to be more prideful 
of their positions and are privy of how DRAFTING 
is just a way to keep them quiet. Speaking against 
this is death at the hands of GOD. Mmmpep...
0003811:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Every so often, to keep morale up,
the military will choose a young CRYPTID to be
a sort of heir to the position of the LEGENDARY
WARLORD, who was also a CRYPTID. 
0003812:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Basically, it means they have to
fill this god of war's shoes as a distraction to
keep others from being wary and questioning
the WAR EFFORT.
0003813:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Like MARINERS, the CRYPTID chosen
is often expected to die in the line of war. They
will be a hero if such conditions are met. But,
if they're lucky, they survive and get to go home.
0003814:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: There is only one religion.

You worship GOD, no questions asked.
0003815:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: But, if you must know, there used
to be a plethora of different religions to choose
from but their praises of peace often end up
creating bloodshed, in an ironic twist of fate.
0003816:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: The religion being followed now is
under the power of GOD. You do not question
GOD unless you prefer to succumb to the sweet
release of death.
0003817:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Most religious text outside those
written under the word of GOD are often considered
mere fables. Like CRYPTID TABLOIDS, they are
seen as trash. Unproven stories of rebels.
0003818:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: They are where the idea of magic
came from, ironically. Some practice old religions
in secret, despite being PROVEN WRONG by word
of GOD. 
0003819:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: In a modern, scientific setting, there
is no time for fairy tales. It is believed that
indulging in such practices only keeps the mind
from advancing into more proper areas.
0003820:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Today, it is believed that 
modernization is the match, and religion is 
the fire extinguisher. The only justified bloodshed
allowed is that for the conquest of knowledge.
0003821:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Some religious nutjobs these days even
attempt to "identify" as a CRYPTID even if they were
born fully human. How absurd, don't you think?
0003822:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Every now and then, a breedery
will birth a child with a MUTATION. These tend
to be the result of "accidental" mixing of CRYPTID
genes with one another. Miaou.
0003823:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: MUTATIONS are fascinating in that
those that survive end up being experimented on
since most that are born with a MUTATION tend
to die at the early stages of life.
0003824:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: There is a rumor going around that
there are breederies made for specifically 
making MUTANT CRYPTIDS for the BATTLEFIELD,
combining the strongest of genes with one another.
0003825:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: They are similar to lab rats except
far more valuable. They can hide in society due
to the fact that they often are tagged with a surname,
making them hard to track down.
0003826:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Those found are captured and shipped
off to the nearest lab for further probing. The
problem is that there are so few of them and
research must go on, even if it breaches rights.
0003827:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Though, since they are born as
CRYPTIDS, they don't have many rights to begin
with so this usually is not a problem. It is GOD's
will, for the sake of the advancement of science!
0003828:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: There is a small group of CRYPTIDS
that used to live up in the mountains that 
secretly advertised anarchy. They often had
the audacity to hide their gospels in song.
0003829:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Younger citizens often fall into their
trap but society considers this to just be a "phase,"
like the turning of the moon, and eventually ends
as the child grows older.
0003830:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Blatant displays of rebellion often
end up in death at the hands of GOD. And thus,
CRYPTIDS spread the word in a more "quiet"
manner usually in songs or slam poetry.
0003831:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Since most of society consider it
to be something for children, such things are
able to go unpunishable and is one of the only
ways to voice out an opinion without consequence.
0003832:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Active rebels are often referred to
as punks or anarchists and are seen in such low
regard, despite the fact that all they want is 
a little respect from their unfortunate lives.
0003833:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: CRYPTIDS are not taken seriously.
They often try to mask their appearances to be 
similar to HUMANS. But, nature always has a way 
of rearing its ugly head from time to time.
0003834:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: \..\..\..if pushed far enough.

Mmmpep...
0003835:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Those who work in BREEDERIES are
cruel people. They are often HUMANS who
partake in creating and conditioning life, one
of the only ways to play GOD.
0003836:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Children are made in batches,
unless they are ALPHAS which are made with
unique, top-notch genes. ALPHAS are very rare
and are often bred for political reasons.
0003837:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Most CRYPTIDS fall into the lowest
category and are conditioned to be not as intelligent 
as HUMANS. This is to ensure that there is always 
a supply of laborers for the ever-growing world.
0003838:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: They tend to not be as receptive
which is a method to keep them from aggressing
since they are far stronger in physical terms and,
well, they have a liking for human flesh.
0003839:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: To give life is a very daunting task,
rewarding in how you're able to build a specimen
however you'd like. Sort of like being some creepy
mad scientist in those old Frankenstein movies.
0003840:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Natural reproduction has been deemed
obsolete for a while due to its slow process. You
cannot raise an army one by one, so breederies
were made to raise life en masse. Pep!
0003841:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Due to such events, sexuality, or gender
for that matter, has no longer been an issue 
since nobody reproduces anymore. A rumor is 
going around that broods are developed infertile. 
0003842:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Every so often, a breedery is designated
to produce a special type of ALPHAS. A handful
of them are selected to be seated at the right hand
of GOD, as political partners. 
0003843:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Most consider these chosen ones
as ROYALTY. They hold noble titles but it's only
for show. Everybody knows that GOD does not
die since everyone believes.
0003844:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: The ROYALTY chosen are often tasked
with more important jobs, such as handling of
laws or, if they are lucky, controlling the tides of
the BATTLEFIELD.
0003845:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: They are bred to be calm of mind
but ruthless decision makers. Such quick-thinking 
and decisiveness makes them be more in control
in seeing what society really desires.
0003846:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Or rather, they choose what society
is allowed to desire. They are, in a sense, like a
sort of illuminati. They control the media, they
control the population.
0003847:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Only those with the highest faith
in GOD are allowed to advertise for GOD.
They are often gifted with riches, a privilege at
an early age to keep them tranced with wealth.
0003848:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: This is a way to keep them preoccupied
with greed. In a sense, GOD can ask anything
of them as long as the consequence ends in
acquiring more currency. Anything for money.
0003849:npc_tinycapn_miaou_derse
!pep!\c[16]ABOMINATION: Reminder: 
superman ain't savin' shint!!!!

0004140:
It's too dark to look for things to prototype this with.
You need a light source of some sort. Perhaps you
can find something outside? 
0004141:
You could perhaps assemble yourself a torch since the light 
source you have with you is too small to get the job done... 
There's not much oil left in that lighter. Perhaps, a branch 
would do in this situation.

You are now the 13th player.

The new kid on the block.

like DOGBREATH DEVILBEAST, do you? Take out your
NAMETAG, dude.

0004288:Варианты выбора:
Be Mamizou.
0004289:
Your name is MAMIZOU. You GREATLY OPPOSE what is 
considered SOCIETAL NORMS these days. Your hobbies 
involve STEALING FROM THE RICH and GIVING AWAY 
THE SPOILS to the less fortunate. 
0004290:
Nothing gets your rocks harder than HELPING OTHERS as 
an insult to said SOCIETAL NORMS. You're the go-to-guy 
for the needy. You like to partake in any sort of GANG 
ACTIVITY so long as its done with GOOD INTENT. 
0004291:
From time to time, you indulge in ROLEPLAYING with your 
friend as a means to teach yourself to TAKE ON IDENTITIES 
for whenever you go out PRANKING. You keep WILD 'COON 
DOGS in your home out of the GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART.
0004292:
You go by the badgerhandle \c[13]ballsyHellraiser\c[0].

You're on a different messenger, since it's easier to use
and has the ability to disguise itself as other chat programs.
0004293:
All the while, you prefer \c[13]talkin all laid back 
and stuff dawgg\c[0]
0004294:
Right now, you've just finished talking to your friend
about some stupid stuff you'd rather not get into
right now because it's not important, okay? What is
important is that you got yourself a seat in on this game.
0004295:
You think you can handle anyone as a client, or whatever
they referred to it as. You're one of the TOP 3 IN THE WORLD
when it comes to MOST THINGS. Just gotta tell people to trust 
you on that.
0004296:

0004297:Варианты выбора:
Mamizou: Check computer.
0004298:
Your files are unpacked and you're ready to put in a client's 
ID at any time. Man, this is going to be mad sweet. You can't  
wait to do... the thing with the game... Your friend is
impressed that you got it to work and you're proud of that. 
0004299:
Maybe then you can convince them to boost that self-confidence
a bit higher, and cheer up.\.\. Wait, you're rambling again.
Counseling appointments run from 3 to 5 PM. It's way too 
late for that. You decide to zip it for now.

0004315:talk_nazrin1
\c[1]!pep!HH: \..\... Man, what the hell, why are you so nice

friends with Houjuu. You guys are both super weird. 
But, at least you're agreeable with things. \c[0]
0004316:talk_nazrin3
\c[1]!pep!HH: But as I was saying, if you pay me 
my "cut," I'll forget about this whole tirade and 
even mess with Hijiri for you, how's that sound?\c[0]
0004317:talk_mamizou2
\c[13]BH: alritey lil dude, so what do you want, like

I did code the game, and you did initially steal it.
Consequences, "dude."\c[0]
0004319:talk_mamizou6
\c[13]BH: 90-10 what the heck?\c[0]
0004320:talk_nazrin1
\c[1]!pep!HH: I threw in the bonus with the
Hijiri-Hassling. That's gotta count for something.\c[0]
0004321:talk_mamizou6
\c[13]BH: and this hijiri is who again?

0004322:talk_nazrin1
\c[1]!pep!HH: Yes. The one who will probably
not care about your well-being or anybody
else's, for that matter. I'm letting you use my
services to annoy the shit out of her.\c[0]
0004323:talk_mamizou2
\c[13]BH: ohhh haha like youre gonna prank

\c[13]BH: okay lil dude you got yourself a cut,
sorry about the game stealin and all, i just didnt
know prior to this that it was your work and stuff\c[0]
0004326:talk_nazrin2
\c[1]!pep!HH: It's fine. If Hijiri starts bothering
you about this, just holler. I'll bug her a bit and
it'll be funny.\c[0]
0004327:talk_mamizou2
\c[13]BH: haha alritey then\c[0]

Nice, you gained the trust of one more person!

+1 CHARISMA.
0004337:

0004338:Варианты выбора:
Mamizou: Let in whoever is outside.
0004339:
Seems like you've got company.

Show yourself, fiend!
0004340:
Oh, it's just one of your many housemates. Seems like
they need you to do something for them. That's fine,
you're always willing to lend out a helping hand, even
if this little munchkin's just hungry or something.
0004341:
Not like you speak their language or anything like that!
But if you did, that would be pretty awesome, but we
don't know that either. It's not important. You didn't
say anything. Who said anything about anything? Not you.
0004342:
It's not anybody's business but yours. Unless they want to 
get in on this but then they'd have to make sure to sign a 
few contracts concerning this pact. You'd totally pull out 
pens and papers for this but you've got other things to do.
0004343:

0004344:Варианты выбора:
Mamizou: Disallow player commands temporarily.
0004345:
You can't be Mamizou because Mamizou doesn't want 
anybody else being Mamizou at the moment.
0004346:
This one just ollie outied right outta your hands on their 
own accord. They totally ignored whatever you wanted to do.

Sorry, \.friend. Go look for some other chump to be, yeah? 
0004347:
So, while Nue gets her junk sorted out\. again\., and Mamizou
is momentarily busy, try another player. Preferably someone 
who's more COMPOSED and doesn't have a CREEPY ALBINO
CROW THING following them around.\.

\c[5]VB: Toyosatomimi, I understand how angry 
you are at the moment, but could you have at 
least warned me first?\c[0]
0004357:xtalk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: time is ticking, you should be getting 
your kernel ready instead of talking to me.\c[0]
0004358:talk_byakuren5
\c[5]VB: Is this for responding to you sarcastically,
but clearly jokingly, prior?\c[0]
0004359:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: If so, then I’m sorry you’ve got incredibly 
thin skin and aren’t capable of taking things with a 
grain of sand.\c[0]
0004360:talk_byakuren3
\c[5]VB: Or could this be about your carelessness 
leading to the death of practically half of 
your friends? \c[0]
0004361:talk_byakuren1
\c[5]VB: I understand that death is a heavy thing 
to deal with and why you would jump into conclusions 
thinking it was my fault (which is really shallow of you, 
by the way) but honestly, this is just childish.\c[0]
0004362:talk_byakuren6

everything on me despite my hands being
clean from the blood of your friends. I had
nothing to do with those things whatsoever.\c[0]

!pep!\c[12]VV: go mess with your kernel and
stop yapping at me, Hijiri. besides, I have

it's all there. I can't babysit for you.\c[0]

you can even begin to entertain the thought of 
compromising with cryptids. thank GOD we're 
not playing with any.\c[0]
0004367:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: How ignorant of you.\c[0]
0004368:talk_byakuren5
\c[5]VB: Do you realize that they're bred to fill 
a low caste in society? That's why they tend to be 
rather unruly.\c[0]
0004369:xtalk_miko1
!pep!\c[12]VV: no, that's just how they are. they're 
at the bottom because of that characteristic. 
they should just feel lucky to even have the 
privilege to copy our moralities. \c[0]
0004370:xtalk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]VV: I have to admit, they do quite a good 
job of it, even if they are expendable.\c[0]
0004371:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: Is that really how you feel? The world 
is not your personal zoo. You can't just use 
them.\c[0]
0004372:xtalk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]VV: I have this nagging feeling that 
you would do the same if you were put in the 
spot. your intentions are very easy to read.\c[0]
0004373:talk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: You are nothing but the force the army 
wields, you don't know anything about humanity, 
so you shouldn't be one to talk.\c[0]
0004374:talk_byakuren5
\c[5]VB: Furthermore, I don't think you should 
be exercising your authority on me, especially 
now, of all times.\c[0]
0004375:xtalk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]VV: oh my, talking like that makes you 
perfect to fill the role for those preachers on tv, 
with your false sincerity and all. you'd be perfect! 
face it, Hijiri, you're about as human as I am.\c[0]
0004376:xtalk_miko2
!pep!\c[12]VV: now, you have about 3 minutes to live
so if you want to take as much time as you want 
ranting at your computer, it's okay. I have my own

Here’s the deal, I’ll make it short for you: I 
lost contact with Kyouko.
0005163:xtalk_byakuren6
\C[5]VB: So? Wait for her to respond back. 
Maybe she’s busy.
0005164:talk_nazrin5
!pep!\C[1]HH: Yes, I will wait patiently, since I have 
all day after all,  while my body burns in the 
most totally not-painful way possible. Maybe 
I should make myself a sandwich while I wait? 
0005165:talk_nazrin7
!pep!\C[1]HH: What should it be? I WAS 
THINKING OF MAKING A GRILLED CHEESE
SANDWICH, HOW ABOUT THAT? 
0005166:xtalk_byakuren6
\C[5]VB: I don't care about what you want to
cook, alright?

!pep!\C[1]HH: I’m joking obviously. DAMN IT.
0005168:talk_nazrin5
!pep!\C[1]HH: I mean SOMETHING HAPPENED! 
All I heard was that she said someone was in 
the house with her or something? Then I lost
connection with her!
0005169:xtalk_byakuren1
\C[5]VB: Oh, sorry, I was engaged in the long 
rant you were giving me. 
0005170:xtalk_byakuren6
\C[5]VB: And don’t you already have your things? 
So stop flipping out, you’ll be fine. 
0005171:xtalk_byakuren4
\C[5]VB: Anyway, I’ll check on Kyouko right now.
I'll keep you posted, so just hold on a little bit.

By this point, you've already thought up of a way to open the

You think it would have been better if the game was about
Mappy taking bribes from the cat burglars. It would have
been so much more realistic, knowing how the enforcers
today do the same things. 
0005516:
You don't think you've seen an actual enforcer act like
how Mappy acts in this game. They probably did in the
past, perhaps? Before the time of GOD even? That's why 
you hate this place so much.
0005517:

Nothing special, both over there, and down here.
0007838:
You've been trying to crossbreed these two in order to
make this one specific type of herb that you've heard

Calmly I possess the universe.

...That would have been pretty deep if it weren't for the fact 
that it's draped over a "BJ MASTER" t-shirt a friend gave to you

don't feel like you're good enough to wear this thing yet.
0007841:
You were talking about the kesa, not the shirt--which you 
will probably only wear if you died and got left behind in
purgatory and only if a ghost forces you to wear it

Preposterous. Moreover, the main characters remind you of

'tis a COD damned emergency!
0008326:talk_murasa5
\c[3]BD: Please respond, aye?
0008327:xtalk_byakuren1
!pep!\c[5]VB: Yes, I'm here, don't worry.\. 
I'll be around until everyone is in.

What do you need? Did you mess up?
0008328:talk_murasa5
\c[3]BD: No, nah at all, thin's went in 
quite smoothly.
0008329:xtalk_byakuren1
!pep!\c[5]VB: Okay, then I don't see why this is
an emergency.
0008330:talk_murasa5
\c[3]BD: I mean, I served wit' no problems, 
she's in the "Medium" as ye are, however...
0008331:xtalk_byakuren6
!pep!\c[5]VB: Did you kill her? I mean, did you 
manage to kill her after you sent her in and now 
you want someone to go there and resurrect her, 
I presume?
0008332:talk_murasa7
\c[3]BD: I... sent her grandfather to the depths, 
though, but 'twas on accident, suffice t' say!
I prototyped the sprite wit' 'im, though, 'n I
was certain that'd fix things with her!
0008333:talk_murasa1
\c[3]BD: No idea fer the life o' me why anyone 
would be so attached to relatives but I've ne'er had 
any so I can't say. Ye should know, so I'm askin' 
ye for assistance on the matter.
0008334:xtalk_byakuren1
!pep!\c[5]VB: Oh, I prototyped my brother.
0008335:talk_murasa3
\c[3]BD: I am aware, and ye stayed content
throughout!
0008336:talk_murasa5
\c[3]BD: Aside, 'cause o' that, she got ratty 'n 
now she refuses to serve fer Nue. I was hopin' ye 
could force some sense into her since she 
completely refuses to cank a convo wit' me.
0008337:xtalk_byakuren6
!pep!\c[5]VB: Wow. I didn't think you'd mess up that 
bad. I considered you as one of the more responsible 
ones. She's not one to get mad easily either, so 
now, I'm wondering about what exactly you did.
0008338:talk_murasa5
\c[3]BD: I only tried to offer assistance.
0008339:xtalk_byakuren5
!pep!\c[5]VB: Oh,\. you babied her.\.

Without realizing it, I guess.
0008340:xtalk_byakuren6
!pep!\c[5]VB: Yeah, you shouldn’t do that, especially, 
knowing you, if it was for the sake of philandering. Kind 
of shallow. You know, like a puddle?\.\. I have no idea 
where I was going with that.
0008341:talk_murasa7
\c[3]BD: ...\.
0008342:xtalk_byakuren5
!pep!\c[5]VB: I was joking with that last part. 
I thought you'd get a laugh out of it. I guess 
I was wrong. Geez, I'm not doing so well with
the jokes today, aren't I?
0008343:talk_murasa7
\c[3]BD: Err.
0008344:xtalk_byakuren3
!pep!\c[5]VB: But, yes, I will talk to her. Sit tight 
and await instructions. I was in the same situation
as you a little while ago, so I think I can handle this.
0008345:talk_murasa3

further command. Thank you, Hijiri.

0008349:
Well, alright then, you are now Byakuren. 

You have just been tasked in pleading for a member of 
your team to join in the game again. 
0008350:

0008351:Варианты выбора:
Byakuren: Carry everyone's burdens.
0008352:
You have to find a way to calm Ichirin down. If one person bails, 
the entire session fails. Besides, you don't want to seem like 
an awful leader and end up having dead team mates like
Toyosatomimi now, would you?
0008353:
Well, you expected this type of freak out from someone
who was raised by a cryptid anyway.\.\.

Not that there's anything wrong with that.\.

your server copy, is that correct? 
0008358:talk_ichirin4
!pep!\c[2]BB: I dont want to play the game hijiri
im really sorry
0008359:talk_ichirin4
!pep!\c[2]BB: I mean like what even is the point if 
were all going to die in the end???? or at least thats 
what i assumed from what murasa said earlier
0008360:talk_ichirin4
!pep!\c[2]BB: Actually no i think i misinterpreted that
0008361:talk_ichirin5
!pep!\c[2]BB: Aw shit now i feel bad!!!!!!
0008362:xtalk_byakuren1
\c[5]VB: People are depending on you, you can’t 
just let them down like that. We’ve come so far, 
we’re so close, don’t be the one to ruin it all. I 
promised everyone a good start, don't let me down.
0008363:talk_ichirin7
!pep!\c[2]BB: What if I give someone else my 
server copy? i cant exactly do a torrent for it
since the file is mad huge
0008364:xtalk_byakuren1

0008365:talk_ichirin7

0008366:talk_ichirin4
!pep!\c[2]BB: Ahh im sorry
0008367:talk_ichirin4
!pep!\c[2]BB: Like for ruining everything but im 
just not in the mood for this kind of thing right now
& i just dont feel too good about even doing this
even though we kind of have to
0008368:xtalk_byakuren1
\c[5]VB: Oh.
0008369:talk_ichirin4
!pep!\c[2]BB: It deals with a few personal
issues i need to get over so im really sorry
0008370:xtalk_byakuren1
\c[5]VB: ...
0008371:xtalk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: Well, it’s just Nue and Mamizou. 
Personally, don’t tell anyone, I think we would 
be so much better off without those two. All 
they’ve done is cause trouble.
0008372:talk_ichirin7
!pep!\c[2]BB: Wait what?
0008373:talk_ichirin7
!pep!\c[2]BB: Uhm hijiri isnt it a bit selfish to
say things like that??????
0008374:xtalk_byakuren3
\c[5]VB: Oh, I thought we were having a little
"selfish thoughts" session right now, so I shared
a few of my own to add with yours.
0008375:talk_ichirin4
!pep!\c[2]BB: Ah\.\.\. i guess i did sound pretty
selfish huh?
0008376:xtalk_byakuren3
\c[5]VB: Everyone needs a little nudge once
in a while.
0008377:talk_ichirin7
!pep!\c[2]BB: Do you really think that way 
about nue and her friend though?
0008378:xtalk_byakuren3
\c[5]VB: Well, you were here pouring out the
truth like that, I didn't want to make you
feel too bad about doing it yourself.
0008379:xtalk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: Everyone has probably thought ill
of things when we had to tackle this giant
obligation. It's normal, but that doesn't mean
we should immediately give up on ourselves.
0008380:xtalk_byakuren3
\c[5]VB: We've come so far! We can't just give
up now, you know what I'm saying here?
0008381:talk_ichirin4
!pep!\c[2]BB: Sorry i acted rather foolish 
back there
0008382:xtalk_byakuren1
\c[5]VB: Aside from worrying over Nue and 
Mamizou, my remaining concern is Minamitsu.
0008383:talk_ichirin7
!pep!\c[2]BB: Wait but nazrin told me nue would
be important or something like that\. and im
pretty sure shed only play if we included her
friend in too
0008384:xtalk_byakuren3
\c[5]VB: I'm aware, I was talking about preference,
however. As you can see, I'm not too fond of
her and her friend but we do need them so we
can't just abandon them despite opinions.
0008385:xtalk_byakuren6
\c[5]VB: They caused a lot of trouble for me
from the other team but there's no point just
sitting around crying about it. 
0008386:talk_ichirin1
!pep!\c[2]BB: Yeah that is true\.\.
seriously though hijiri you always know what
to say in these situations\. so thank you
0008387:talk_ichirin7
!pep!\c[2]BB: I should probably go apologize huh
0008388:xtalk_byakuren5
\c[5]VB: You should save that for later.
Knowing her, she'll probably get distracted
and forget about everything. For now,
just focus on serving for Nue.
0008389:talk_ichirin4
!pep!\c[2]BB: Ah right right but i still will
apologize because now i feel pretty awful
about the stuff i said
0008390:talk_ichirin7
!pep!\c[2]BB: Even if she did deserve it
0008391:talk_ichirin6
!pep!\c[2]BB: Ill give her a bit of time to think about
what she did though...... it was still wrong of
her & i kinda want her to realize that
0008392:xtalk_byakuren3
\c[5]VB: Yeah, well, you won't be able to
apologize to her if she turns up dead, now,
right? So, just focus on what you have to
do while I try to monitor the others.
0008393:talk_ichirin3
!pep!\c[2]BB: I knew there was a reason we
chose you leader!!!!!! Dont worry hijiri i wont
let you down i promise!!!!!!

that was weeks ago, 'n I didn' really reckon
ye were serious about it.

You decide to contact your client player instead. You might

the current problem! Yes. Totally.

0008456:talk_murasa5

It's a package from Futo. Looks like she wasn't lying
about it. It looks like your crewmate was trying to
bring it in and they seem unharmed, albeit a little

You might as well open it. Your mind is still drawing blanks

hat you wore since you were a kid. It's a bit faded and worn, 
and looks a little tacky, so you try to work with what you have

That was intense.
0008856:
Though, it's interesting to note that those who have died in the 
ship were implied to have become greedy ghosts just because 
they all wanted to get a piece of that gold hoard. Something like 
that, honestly, you were just in it for that wire scene.

It's a map of local sea routes. The map has been tossed,

These were meant to be used for hunting, but you've only 
been using them on your 'coon dogs, when they get amped 
up. You kind of just... toss it at them to ensnare them and 
calm them down a bit.
0009838:
You haven't been using these in a while though. 

Things have been quiet lately.
0009839:
But, now, things are about to get intense, so you might as well
take these just in case.

You've been keeping rather important texts in here, most of

...Or at least that's what you think they're saying.
You never said you could communicate with them! You can
just sort of understand their intentions from the way they look 
and stuff like that, yeah.
0009857:
You tell the dog it is sad and you end up thinking about what
this has to do with anything at all, or if it was a weird attempt
at humor on your end there.
0009858:
Whatever it was, the dog isn't listening to you. It seems
way too preoccuppied with its paws.

It's a huge pile of contracts that you like to sift through every

you make sure they sign a contract so they may adhere to
the rules and you always are aware of what's going on.

If anyone breaks a contract, you usually fine them a hefty
sum of money.

Your last theory entry gained a pretty good amount of attention,

These statues were brought home by the small, furry freeloaders

You only watched this one since you heard Al Pacino was

and he did not fail to deliver. This guy is just good for movies.
0009878:
Still, though, that fish in the vest thing was clever. It'd make
for a great prank, if you look at it in a more benevolent way.

But after seeing the film, you really can't, ha ha...

You try to open the cabinet but then an entire pile of
Slim Jims just fall out. You end up desperately picking
them all up and shoving them back in there. It seems
that you may or may not have just been pranked.

Judging from the way that it smells like doggy slobber, you
conclude that this towel is in no way as fresh as you initially
thought it was.

0010198:
These statues were brought home by the small, furry freeloaders 
living with you. They've been taking them from "abandoned" 
stores that haven't been using them anymore. You don't mind 
these, however. They're cool to have around, yo.

From what you remember, this movie had no conflict at all
but still managed to be pretty okay. It somehow proved
that it's the journey that counts, not so much the ending.
Though, there are a lot of people who would disagree.
0010201:
And, that's okay too. That's the beauty of films, they can
practically be anything they want to be. That's why so many
bad art house movies filmed in grainy 8mm exist.

There's a small pile of hair in random corners. You almost
forgot how bad raccoon dogs shed. They're almost like cats
except they are like a hundred percent more baller than cats 
even if they kind of act the same. They're just cooler, okay!

It's actually full of pranking manuals. You've studied many
of them but even then, you can't stop yourself from being 
pranked yourself. That's alright, you guess, as long as it's 
all done in good fun, right?
